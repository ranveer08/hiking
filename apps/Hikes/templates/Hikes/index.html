         <h2>Rattlesnake Ledge (Snoqualmie Pass)</h2>
         <p>
            Difficulty: Easy<br>
            Length: 4 miles roundtrip<br>
            For a short and relatively easy day hike, it doesn't get much better than a gently-sloping trail through old
            growth forest, a view over Snoqualmie Pass and the Southern Cascades, and a trailhead only 40 minutes east of
            Seattle. The hike starts off on the shores of Rattlesnake Lake and cuts through a series of switchbacks that
            rise 1,000 feet over 1.5 miles. The path is steadily uphill but never overly difficult, which means that the
            ledge is crowded on weekends and sunny summer days (it's a great option for watching the sunset after work or as
            a trail run). Before or after the hike, the lake itself is a great place to relax, walk, swim, and fish. For
            tougher hikes near the city, popular Little Si and Mount Si (below) across the valley are similar but slightly
            more challenging.

         <h2>Little Si and Mount Si (Snoqualmie Pass)</h2>
         <p>
            Difficulty: Easy; moderate<br>
            Length: 5 miles; 8 miles<br>
            The easy access to Little Si and Mount Si make them two of the highly-trafficked day hikes in the Seattle area.
            We like Little Si best, which is a 5-mile roundtrip excursion with around 1,200 feet in elevation gain. The
            forested path is excellent and there are a number of interesting rock formations along the way (it's also very
            popular for climbing). The top has good views of North Bend, the Upper Snoqualmie Valley, and Mount Si hovering
            above to the north. Mount Si is a more involved day hike at a distance of 8 miles roundtrip and with an
            elevation gain of around 3,150 feet. It's not that Mount Si isn't a really nice hike, it's just that we think
            there are better options for that kind of effort (see Granite Mountain below).

         <h2>Mt. Pilchuck (Mountain Loop Highway)</h2>
         <p>
            Difficulty: Moderate<br>
            Length: 5.4 miles roundtrip<br>
            For a moderate one-day summit from Seattle, it's tough to find a better hike than the one up Mt. Pilchuck.
            Located on the Mountain Loop Highway just over an hour north of downtown, this hike offers big-time scenery
            quickly and will not disappoint. You rise with views of the North Cascades and classic alpine terrain, finally
            curling around the summit for huge expanses including the Olympic Peninsula, Puget Sound, San Juan Islands, and
            Mt. Rainier. This hike is only 5.4 miles roundtrip but relatively steep and therefore intermediate in
            difficulty.
         </p>

         <p>
            The biggest issue with Mt. Pilchuck is the crowds. In many ways, this is the mini-Mt. Everest of Seattle-we'hv
            hiked it on a clear summer Sunday and literally been in a line of 30-40 hikers near the top. Even on a blustery
            February weekday we came across 20-30 hikers battling snow and ice along the way. This doesn't mean that you
            shouldn't do Mt. Pilchuck, just try to get up early. If you can depart your Seattle home by 6am, grab a double
            latte, and hit the road, you can be at the trailhead by 7:30am. By doing this you will avoid the vast majority
            of people. Show up at 11am and you may see your neighbors and coworkers up there too.

         <h2>Ebey's Landing (Whidbey Island)</h2>
         <p>
            Start: End of Cook Road to the Prairie Overlook trailhead<br>
            Difficulty: Moderate<br>
            Length: Up to 5.6 miles roundtrip<br>
            Perched on the western shore of Whidbey Island with views of the Olympic Mountains and Strait of San Juan de
            Fuca, Ebey's Landing is our favorite Washington coastal hike.
            Named after Issac Ebey who built the island's first settlement, this trail passes high along the bluff with
            excellent opportunities for wildlife watching, including bald eagles soaring along the cliffs, seals and sea
            lions playing in the surf, and even orca pods feeding on salmon in the summer.
            Toward the end of the bluff, the trail intersects the original and restored homestead from 1850 before
            zigzagging down the side of the cliff to the stony beach (an easier option is to return the same way via the
            high side of the bluff).
            This is a superb early morning and sunset hike, although it's excellent anytime the views are clear.

         <h2>Summerland (Mt. Rainier National Park)</h2>
         <p>
            Start: Mt. Rainier National Parkâ€”White River Entrance<br>
            Difficulty: Moderate<br>
            Length: 8.4 miles roundtrip<br>
            If you can only do one summer full-day hike in Washington, the hike to Summerland in Mt.
            Rainier National Park is your best bet.
            This pristine alpine meadow is the starting point for climbers heading up Mt. Rainier's southern slopes and one
            of the best places in the state to view wildflowers.
            The trail passes upward through old-growth forests along the White River until the trees give way to spectacular
            mountain vistas.
            Summerland, which is 4.2 miles from the trailhead, is an open meadow full of marmots, wildflowers, and
            spectacular views of Mt. Rainier.
            For those looking for more mileage, Panhandle Gap is another 1.4 miles from Summerland.
            This is a popular trail and it's best to get started early before the bulk of the crowds arrive.
            Camping is possible in Summerland but spaces are limited and drawn via lottery months in advance.

         <h2>Chain Lakes Loop (North Cascades/Mt. Baker)</h2>
         <p>
            Start: End of the Mt. Baker Highway<br>
            Difficulty: Moderate<br>
            Length: 8 miles<br>
            The Chain Lakes Loop offers a grand tour of the North Cascades: towering peaks, wildflower meadows, shimmering
            lakes, and great views of Mt. Baker and Shuksan.
            From the Bagley Lakes Trailhead, the path leads past a series of lakes-some still bordered by snow late into the
            year-and up the Herman Saddle.
            The trail then navigates the pass between Table Mountain and Ptarmigan Ridge before continuing to Artist Point.
            Famous for the imagery of Mt. Shuksan reflecting in its waters, Artist Point is one of the highlights of hiking
            in the North Cascades.
            For those who don't have time for the entire loop, it's also possible to park at the Artist Point lot and go
            directly to the lake (when the road is open).
            The Chain Lakes Loop is crowded on summer weekends but much less so during the week.
